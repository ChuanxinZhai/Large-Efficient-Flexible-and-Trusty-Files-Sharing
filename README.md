# Large-Efficient-Flexible-and-Trusty-Files-Sharing

Using **Python** Socket network programming to design and implement a Large Efficient Flexible and Trusty (LEFT) Files Sharing program

### Requirements:

Large:
• Format: files with any format and folders (excluding hidden files and folders)
• Size: single file is up to 500MB

Efficient:
• Fast: the faster, the better
• Automatic: the new files/folders and changed files/folders can be synchronized automatically

Flexible:
• The IP addresses of peers should be set as an argument (only two peers)
• Resume from interruption

Trusty:
• No Error for any files


Application layer protocol: Design own protocol. Any existed mature application protocols, such as HTTP and FTP are not allowed to be used.

Transport layer protocol:
• TCP;

Architecture:
• C/S; or P2P; or Mixed.

Port number:
• Any port between 20000 to 30000 can be used;
• can use one or more ports.
